This is also the eight time that BTS has topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. “Dynamite” made it to the top spot three times, while “Life Goes On" (2020) and Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo's remix of "Savage Love (Laxed-Siren Beat)" (2020) both made it to number one once.

“No. 1 for three weeks? It’s all thanks to ARMY [BTS's fans]. I’m moved and moved again,” band member Suga wrote on fan community app Weverse.

According to Billboard’s statistics, “Butter” maintained a high number of downloads, only falling by one percent compared to the previous week. At the same time, an increase in its radio airtime and the two remix versions of “Butter” that dropped on June 4 contributed to this week’s record.

BTS’s agency Big Hit Music will release a physical album featuring “Butter” on July 9. Pre-orders for the album start today.
